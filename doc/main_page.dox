 * @section intro_sec Introduction
 *
 * The Cloud Digital Interface (CDI) SDK is the library which implements the low-latency reliable transport
 * of data between EC2 instances within the Amazon network. The SDK takes care of the complex task of ensuring that
 * large amounts of data is seamlessly transferred across the AWS network using complex, multi-path technology to
 * ensure lossless quality without the need for extensive network buffering and delay.
 *
 * The SDK consists of two main API layers, depending on the desired level of functionality, and a common core layer.
 * The CDI Audio, Video and Metadata (CDI-AVM) layer takes care of transferring multi-stream, modern video signals
 * that contain video, audio and metadata. The CDI Raw Payload (CDI-RAW) layer takes care of transferring raw
 * generic payloads. The CDI Core (CDI-CORE) layer takes care of common core functionality. The API layers are
 * described in the sections below:
 *
 * @section avm_sec CDI Audio, Video and Metadata (CDI-AVM) API
 * For transporting audio, video and metadata between multiple applications where definition of the payload data needs
 * to be clearly defined, the CDI-AVM API can be used.
 *
 * @ref AVM_home_page
 *
 * @section raw_sec CDI Raw Payload (CDI-RAW) API
 * For transporting raw data that is defined outside the scope of this API, the CDI-RAW API can be used.
 *
 * @ref raw_home_page
 *
 * @section core_sec CDI Core (CDI-CORE) API
 * For managing connections, the CDI Core API can be used.
 *
 * @ref Core_home_page
 *
 * @section utils_sec CDI Utilities
 * As a convenience for developers, APIs for additional utility functions are provided.
 *

// Doxygen Page for RX Payload Formats
/*! @page rx_payload_page RX Payload Formats
 * @tableofcontents
 *
 * @section rx_payload RX Payload Formats
 * To allow optimal performance and application flexibility, there are two methods that define how payload data is
 * formatted in the receiver and presented to the application via the CdiRawRxCallback() and CdiAvmRxCallback()
 * user defined callback functions. They are described below.
 *
 * The first method is the Scatter-Gather List (SGL) Format. In this mode, as network packets arrive in NIC RX
 * buffers, the SDK generates a SGL of payload data addresses and sizes. Once the entire payload has been received, the
 * SGL is presented to the application. This allows the application to receive the payload with zero memory copying.
 *
 * The other method is the Linear Storage (LS) Format. In this mode, as network packets arrive, payload data is copied
 * from NIC RX buffers to a linear buffer. Depending on system capabilities, this operation may use DMA hardware
 * assistance. Once the entire payload has been received, the payload is presented to the application in the form of a
 * Scatter-Gather List (SGL) with a single entry pointing to the linear buffer. As part of creating an RX connection
 * the application defines which method to use.
 *
 * The diagram shown below describes the available payload formats presented to the receiver when a payload is received.

// Doxygen Page for User-Registered Callback Functions
/*! @page cb_flows_page User-Registered Callback Functions
 * @tableofcontents
 *
 * @section cb_flows_func User-Registered Callback Functions
 * There are some user-registered callback functions that must be implemented by the application. Each allows a
 * user-defined parameter called "user_cb_param" to be passed to each of the callback functions. This can be used by
 * the application to relate a TX payload or RX connection with the callback.
 *
 * When using the CDI-RAW API, the transmitter must implement the CdiRawTxCallback() function. This callback function
 * is invoked when a complete payload has been transmitted and acknowledged as being received by the receiver. The
 * receiver must implement the CdiRawRxCallback() function. This callback function is invoked when a complete payload
 * has been received. The receiving application must use the CdiCoreRxFreeBuffer() API to free the buffer. This can
 * either be done within the user callback function or at a later time whenever the application is done with the
 * buffer.
 *
 * When using the CDI-AVM API, the transmitter must implement the CdiAvmTxCallback() function and the receiver the
 * CdiAvmRxCallback() function.
 *
 * The diagram shown below describes the user-defined parameter's data flow for both callback functions using the
 * CDI-RAW API. The flow is the same for the CDI-AVM API.

// Doxygen Page for PTP Timestamp Usage
/*! @page ptp_timestamp_page Managing Timestamp Data
 * @tableofcontents
 *
 * @section SDK Timestamp Management
 * PTP timestamps are sent along with all payloads as part of the payload config. These PTP timestamps are SMPTE ST
 * 2059-2 compliant with the exception that the seconds field is limited to 32-bits instead of the specified 48-bits.
 * The timestamps are expected to be created at origination of the media stream with the use of a PTP time source.
 *
 * The SDK provides for converting PTP timestamps into RTP timestamps by using the CdiUtilityPtpToRtp() function. This
 * function converts a PtpTimestamp into a 32-bit RTP timestamp in units of the specified sample rate. For ST 2110
 * video or ancillary data the sample rate should be 90kHz, audio streams should use the audio sample rate for RTP
 * timestamp creation.
 *
 * PTP timestamps are sent as part of all SDK payload headers for RAW and AVM payloads. The PTP timestamps are sent
 * with the functions CdiAvmTxVideoPayload(), CdiAvmTxAudioPayload(), CdiAvmTxAncillaryPayload(), CdiAvmTxRawPayload(),
 * and CdiRawTxPayload().
 *
 * The origination_ptp_timestamp exists as part of CdiCoreExtraData which is used by CdiCoreTxPayloadConfig
 * and CdiAvmTxPayloadConfig on the sender side and as part of callback data structure CdiCoreCbData and
 * CdiAvmRxCbData.
 *
 * When tracking time within the AWS network use CdiCoreGetUtcTime() to get the highest precision network synced time
 * available in AWS. Using Amazon Time Sync Service described below will help in getting the best
 * precision network time.
 *
 * If there is a need to compare time codes with network time it is STRONGLY recommended that any instances being used
 * for getting time are configured to use Amazon Time Sync Service. Configuration instructions below:
 *

 * Windows Setup Instructions</a>

 * The diagram below shows how timestamps sit within the larger SDK data structures.
